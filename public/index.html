          Reading Sandijs Ruluks' article, <i>A Brief History of Web Design</i> reminded me of the Epcot ride: <q>Spaceship Earth</q> which tells the story of the evolution of modern communication.  This is partially because Judi Dench describes the Roman road system as <q>the first world wide web</q> at one point, but also because there are some similarities in the evolution of the internet and print communication. Ruins, the latin alphabet and roman numerals all have a ridged structure that the early internet had.  Probably, because working within a table or grid is naturally an easy way to begin, which is why when smart phones hit the market, developers and designers returned to a grid.  Of course, as a form of communication develops, it will suffer from excess.  For printing it was the illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Kells, and for the internet it was flash.  Both made things exciting, but also slowed down the work.

          The popularity of minimalism waxes and wanes throughout history, and Ruluks notes that 2010 saw a return to minimalism, which <q>the web was close to this from the very beginning.</q> Examples of this is the streamlining and simplification are: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>html5</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>Atom</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          These languages are capable of more but are easier to learn and becoming closer to English in its language and syntax.  I think this trend will continue until the job field is oversaturated and then, to ensure their employability and superiority, developers will begin to create more powerful and complicated language.
